NLPlaying
=========

This repository hosts my little scripts/tests in the field of Natural Language
Processing (and Information Retrieval).

The main ideia is to implement everything in pure Python to learn the concepts
(except for data, which I'm using some corpora found on
`NLTK <http://www.nltk.org/>`_ but you can use any kind of data in text format).

See ``example.py`` and ``test_*.py`` for more details.
