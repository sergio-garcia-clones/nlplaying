NLPlaying
=========

This repository hosts my little scripts/tests in the field of Natural Language
Processing (and Information Retrieval).

The main ideia is to implement everything that is directly involved into NLP
concepts in pure Python to learn how it really works. Some things like corpora
and some algorithms probably will be borrowed from
`NLTK <http://www.nltk.org/>`_.

See ``example.py`` and ``test_*.py`` for more details.
